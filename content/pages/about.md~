Title: About 
Slug: about-me
Author: Guilherme Pedrosa

Pelican is an acronym for "capelin" which means notebook in french. This is exactly why I 
have started this blog: moving the notes on my notebook to the web.

I am a mechanical engineer, working in the data science field. I was first presented
to matlab to do research in optimization, moving to SIMULINK for a project
in the mechanical vibration area dealing with flow induced vibration. 
My senior project was in Fluid Dynamics using the FEniCS library and that was my 
first contact with the python language. Along the way I have 
also put to some use LaTeX with Jinja2 templating engine and R, to a lesser extent.

Currently I have also been exploring concepts of software development for object
oriented projects and database design. I am also interested in optimal workflows for
reproductibility.

I am also going to blog about some non tech related topics, such as: music, arts, 
travel and my side projects.

Cheers,

Guilherme Pedrosa
