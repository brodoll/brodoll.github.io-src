  Howdy!
</p>

I am a mechanical engineer, working in the data science field. I was first presented
to matlab to do research in optimization, moving to SIMULINK for a project
in the mechanical vibration area dealing with flow induced vibration. 
My senior project was in Fluid Dynamics using the FEniCS library and that was my 
first contact with the python language. Along the way I have 
also put to some use LaTeX with Jinja2 templating engine and R, to a lesser extent.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
